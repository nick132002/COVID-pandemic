# COVID-pandemic
 
## Symptoms of Coronavirus

# What you need to know
* Anyone can have mild to severe symptoms.
* Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.

## Watch for symptoms
People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.

Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:

* Cough
* Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
* Fever
* chills
* Muscle pain
* Headache
* Sore throat
* New loss of taste or smell

This list is not all possible symptoms. Other less common sy,ptoms have been reported,including gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea,vomiting, or diarrhea

## When to Seek Emergency Medical Attention

Look for emergency warning signs* for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately

* Trouble breathing
* Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
* New confusion
* Inability to wake or stay awake
* Bluish lips or face

*This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.

Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility: Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19.

## Testing for COVID-19

Guidance on Interpreting COVID-19 Test Results:A guide for interpreting test results and determining what actions to take.

Two kinds of tests are available for COVID-19: viral tests and antibody tests.

* A viral test tells you if you have a current infection.
* An antibody test tells you if you had a previous infection.

An antibody test may not be able to show if you have a current infection, because it can take 1-3 weeks after infection to make antibodies. We do not know yet if having antibodies to the virus can protect someone from getting infected with the virus again, or how long that protection might last.

## Who should be tested
To learn if you have a current infection, viral tests are used. But not everyone needs this test.

* Most people will have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care and may not need to be tested.

* CDC has guidance for who should be tested, but decisions about testing are made by state and localexternal icon health departments or healthcare providers.

* If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first.

* You can also visit your state or local health department’s website to look for the latest local information on testing.

* Although supplies of tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find a place to get tested.

# Results

* If you test positive for COVID-19 by a viral test, know what protective steps to take if you are sick or caring for someone.

* If you test negative for COVID-19 by a viral test, you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected. However, that does not mean you will not get sick. The test result only means that you did not have COVID-19 at the time of testing.

 If you test positive or negative for COVID-19, no matter the type of test, you still should take preventive measures to protect yourself and others.

# Test for Current Infection

Viral tests check samples from your respiratory system (such as swabs of the inside of the nose) to tell you if you currently have an infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Some tests are point-of-care tests, meaning results may be available at the testing site in less than an hour. Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once received by the lab.

If you test positive or negative for COVID-19, no matter the type of test, you still should take preventive measures to protect yourself and others.

## How to decide if you should get a viral test

Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19. Here is some information that might help you make decisions about getting a viral test.

* Most people have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care. They may not need to be tested.

* At this time, there is no treatment specifically approved for people who have COVID-19.

CDC has guidance for who should be tested, but decisions about testing are made by state and local health departments or healthcare providers.

## How to get a viral test

COVID-19 testing differs by location. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first. You can also visit your state or localexternal icon health department’s website to look for the latest local information on testing. Although supplies of tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find a place to get tested.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized two viral tests that let you collect either a nasal swabexternal icon or a saliva sampleexternal icon at home. However, you will still need to send your sample to a laboratory for analysis.

## What to do after a viral test

To get your test result, please check with the group that performed your test, such as your healthcare provider or your health department. Check the CDC website to locate your health department information. How long it will take to get your test results back depends on the test used.

* If you test positive for COVID-19, know what protective steps to take

* If you test negative for COVID-19, you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected. However, that does not mean you will not get sick. It is possible that you were very early in your infection when your sample was collected and that you could test positive later. Or you could be exposed later and then develop illness. In other words, a negative test result does not mean you won’t get sick later. This means you could still spread the virus.

# Test for Past Infection

Antibody blood tests,also called antibody tests,check your blood by looking for antibodies which show if you had a previous infection with the virus.Depending on when someone was infected and timing of the test, the test may not find anitbodies in someone with a current COVID-19 infection.Antibodies are proteins that help fight off infections.Antibody tests should not be used to diagnose someone as being currently sick with COVID-19.To see if you have a current infection,you need a viral test,which checks respiratory samples,such as a swab from inside your nose.

Antibody tests are available through healthcare providers and laboratories.

If you test positive or negative for COVID-19,no matter the type of test,you still should take preventive measures to protect yourself and others.

## How to get an antibody test

check with your healthcare provider to see if they offer antibody tests.

### If you test positive

* A positive test result shows you have antibodies that likely resulted from an infection with SARS-CoV-2, or possibly a related coronavirus. 

* It's unclear if those antibodies can provide protection (immunity) against getting infected again. This means that we do not know at this time if antibodies make you immune to the virus

* if you have no symptoms you likely do not have an active infection and no additional follow-up is needed.

* If you have symptoms and meet other guidelines for testing, you would need another type of test called a nucleic acid test or viral test. This test uses respiratory samples, such as a swab from inside your nose, to confirm COVID-19. An antibody test cannot tell if you are currently sick with COVID-19.

* It's possible you might test positive for antibodies and you might not have or have ever had symptoms of covid-19 known as having an asymptomatic infection, or an infection without symptoms.

## If you test negative

* if you test negative for COVID-19 antibodies,you probably did not have a previous infection that has gotten better.However you could have a current infection, its possible you could still get sik if you have been exposed to the virus recently,since antibodies dont show up for 1 to 3 weeks after infection without symptoms. This means you can still spread the virus.

* Some people may take even longer to develop antibodies, and some people may not develop antibodies.

* If you have symptoms and meet other guidelines for testing, you would need another type of test called a nucleic acid testor viral test. This test uses respiratory samples, such as a swab from inside your nose, to comfirm COVID-19.An antibody test cannot tell if you are currently sick with COVID-19.

## CDC’s work in antibody testing

CDC is evaluating commercial tests

CDC is evaluating the performance of commercially manufactured antibody tests in collaboration with other goverment agencies. FDA has authorized emergency use of several antibody tests.

For more information:

* FDA Emergency Use Authorizations for COVID-19

* Insight into FDA’s Revised Policy on Antibody Tests: Prioritizing Access and Accuracy

CDC is conducting serologic surveillance

CDC is looking at data from antibody tests to estimate the total number of people who have been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 in the United States. CDC is also using antibody testing to learn more about how the body’s immune system responds to the virus and to explore how the virus spreads among people exposed to it. The information CDC is looking at comes from many groups, including blood donors and household contacts of people who had symptoms and were diagnosed with COVID-19.

CDC is supporting state, local, tribal and territorial laboratory capacity.
